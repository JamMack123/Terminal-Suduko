Final Project: Algorithm X and the Cover Problem
Program Description:
For our project, we decided to implement Algorithm X in c++. Algorithm X is a way to find the rows of a matrix that will solve a universal set.
We implemented the algorithm using a main .cpp file and a .cpp/.h algx file. We created 6 functions in the algx.cpp file to implement the Algorithm.
Functions:
Cover = Covers a column in the matrix and all the adjacent cells connected to the column
Uncover = Uncover a column and all the adjacent cells that were connected
findStartColumn = Searches the matrix for the column that has the least amount of 1's/true's which will be thw initial column added to the solution vector
		  in the search function
search = This is the main function taht searches the given problem matrix for the rows that solve the universal set
createLinkedMatrix = This function takes the problem matrix that is given and converts to a matrix of 1's and 0's and linkes all the cells to the cells of teh columns and rows around it.
		     Each cell is linked up, down, left, right, to other cells.  
solve = This calls on all the functions to be able to solve the problem matrix and returns the ans vector for the test_program output.

Included Files:
	- algx.cpp/.h
	- test_program.cpp
	- Makefile
	- README

Running instructions:
	- In a terminal go to the directory where the Makefile, algx.cpp/.h and test_program.cpp files are saved and
	type make into the terminal then after the files compile, type ./test_program to run the program.
	- To test different problem matrix's in the test_program.cpp file different sizes for maxRow or col's can be
	changed and which cell's are true or false.

Notes and Assumptions
	- The idea and how to solve a cover problem using Algorithm X came from multiple websites detailing the basis
	of what the algorithm runs on. https://www.kth.se/social/files/58861771f276547fe1dbf8d1/HLaestanderMHarrysson_dkand14.pdf is the source
	that helped with the idea of the Algorithm the most.
