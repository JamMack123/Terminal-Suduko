Assignment 2 Part 2

Included Files:
	- algx.cpp/.h
	- program.cpp/sh
	- Errors, Expected, Inputs, Outputs, Resources folders
	- opentestcenter.sh
	- testcenter.ini
	- README


Running instructions:
	Test Center Version
	- In the directory of where the files are, type ./opentestcenter.sh and the
	test center should pop up. Either press ctrl + R to run the program or 
	click on the Run tab then Run all and all the test cases will be tested. 
	- To see the test cases, go into the test case folder and go into the Inputs folders to see all the input files

Notes and Assumptions
	- The basis of the files for the testcenter were borrowed from a testcenter for the morning problems. We ran into a
	few problems merging the testcenter and the format of our program seeing as we were including header files in the main
	cpp file. 
	- The idea and how to solve a cover problem using Algorithm X came from multiple websites detailing the basis of what the algorithm runs on.
