Included Files 
	-program directory
		-Contains program.cpp
		-Files for running algorthim
	-test-cases 
		-Contains multiple directories
		that contain the information to run the test-cases
	-README
		The readme file relevant to test center information
	-opentestcentre.sh
		-bash file to run testcentre program
	-testcenter.ini
		-configuration file for test center

Running instruction:
	-It is likely you already know how to run this, however if you do not know how to run the test center you must have a terminall open and located within this current directory by typing ./opentestcenter the test center application should open and run allow for you to see the results of the algorthim.
	-To see the code for the soln and algorthim in the test center navigate to the program directory and there the files for the algorthim and the program.cpp file are located

Notes and assumptions:
	-It is assumed that the user will already have the morning problem test center installed upon there machine before trying to use these files else the bash call will likely fail because it doesn't have any idea what sort of thing your calling.


TEST CENTER FORMATTING:
	This information is provided so if the user would like to create there own test cases they have the tools on how to do so

	This section of the README file serves as a guide on how to create test files that work with the submission.

	All input files are formatted in a specfic way. In this document <> will be used to represent a value put inside of it for example:
	<An integer value> would be replace by 7 in the input file.
	The format for all submission files is as follows with all data being of type int:

	<Number of subsets (N represents the number of subsets)> <length of universal set>
	<The universal set in sequential order>
	<Subset 1> //All subsets must contain the same number of values as the universal set with the value of 0 being placeholder Refer to example below
	<Subset 2>
	<Subset 3>
	<........>
	<........>
	<........>
	<Subset N>

	An example containg numbers is as follows:
	3 3
	1 3 4
	1 0 0
	0 0 4
	1 3 0

	The zero is required as a placeholder for the current version of the solution. This simply because when the solution was coded I could not think of an easy way to deal with none uniform sized sets. 

	Many of the test cases we have already created are smaller tests to simply determine if the algorthim works. Upon large test cases this algorthim could timeout with the default timout conditions defined
